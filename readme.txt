Welcome to the MMA Match-Maker app, Fighter Pro, an innovative and dynamic React Native project that brings a unique twist to fight matchmakingâ€”think "Tinder for fighting." Developed for both iOS and Android using React Native Expo for swift development, this solo project demonstrates proficiency in key functionalities such as Stylesheet, ScrollView, Flatlist, Button, and StatusBar, complemented by the integration of the TailWind CSS framework. Users can seamlessly navigate through five different screens, engaging in matches and messaging other users they've matched with. Leveraging dependencies from expo and react, the app ensures a smooth and captivating user experience. Future development plans include implementing a relational database for user information and matching on the backend, introducing features like photo and audio messaging, and exploring the possibility of integrating an AI API for BMI estimation based on body scans.
